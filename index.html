        <h2>About Me</h2>

        <p>Hello and welcome to my portfolio page.  My name is Sean Gowing.  I have a multitude of life experience and decided that web development was going to be my next new frontier</p>

        <p>Prior to doing web development I was a US Marine for 7 years.  I did one deployment to Iraq in 2004 in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. One thing I can say about Iraq was "It's hot!!!!" The hottest day, while we were there, was 135 degrees</p>
  
        <p>After getting out of the Marine Corps I was a Police Officer for 15 years.  Due to a back injury, I was forced to retire at 38 years old.  This brought me to my next new career in programming and web development.  I really enjoy working with computers and have been using since 386's came out.</p>

        <p>This portfolio will be a work in progress for me and I hope you enjoy seeing the projects that I am working on.</p>
